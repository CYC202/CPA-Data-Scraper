# CPA-Data-Scraper

## Project Name
CPA Data Scraper

## Description
This project involves scraping the China Association of Certified Public Accountants (CICPA) website to gather information on all registered CPAs in China, totaling over 100,000 individuals. Additionally, data regarding their registration status is obtained from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).

## Overview
The CPA Data Scraper efficiently collects and consolidates CPA information from the CICPA website (https://cmis.cicpa.org.cn/#/login), while addressing challenges related to system changes and captcha verification that render previous scraping code unusable. This project successfully implements new solutions to bypass these obstacles, ensuring reliable data retrieval.

## Features
- **Data Scraping**: Extracts comprehensive information on over 100,000 registered CPAs from the CICPA website.
- **Status Verification**: Gathers and integrates current registration status data from the CSRC, enhancing the quality of the dataset.
- **Captcha Bypass**: Develops and implements new strategies to navigate captcha challenges, ensuring the scraper remains functional despite system updates.
- **Data Cleaning**: Processes and organizes scraped data for easy analysis and use.

## Challenges Overcome
- **System Changes**: Adapted to changes in the CICPA website structure and functionality, ensuring successful data extraction.
- **Captcha Implementation**: Addressed the introduction of copyable captchas, creating effective solutions to maintain the scraper's usability.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensured the accuracy and completeness of the scraped data through rigorous validation processes.
